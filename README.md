### Motivation: 
Actually Saw my aunt do manual work on her school result. So got and idea to create a result-app for schools ;)

# What App Will Do
Wanna see following thnings in the app at the base: 
<ol>
<li> Teacher will Input Marks Manually (Won't accept from excel since typing in excel also requires manual entires so why not to directly enter in the app) </li>
 <li> Class drop-down so that subject will be automatically loaded for the mention class </li>
<li> Make the dynamic result on-time. Subject wise plus overall grading and percentage. </li> 
<li> Preview result online </li> 
<li>Generate Individual MarksheetGenerate PDF Report for Each Class/ Section </li> 
<li> Save marks to DB </li>
 <li> Conformation Flash Message </li>
</ol>
